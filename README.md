# Getting Started with social Django Development

If you're ready to start developing social with Django, follow these steps to set up your development environment and
get the required dependencies:

## Prerequisites

Before diving into social development, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python:** social is built with Python, so make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it
  from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Django:** social is integrated with Django, a popular Python web framework. Install Django using pip:

  ```bash
  pip install django

## Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

- It's a good practice to work in a virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies. Create one using:
  ```bash
  python -m venv myenv
  ```
- Activate the virtual environment On Windows:
  ```bash 
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

## Setting Up Your social Development Environment:

1. Clone the social Repository:
   Start by cloning the social GitHub repository to your local machine:

- Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/social.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   Change your working directory to the social project folder:
   ```bash
   cd social
   ```

3. Install Project Dependencies:
   Install the project-specific dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    pip-compile requirements.in
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the Database and `Create a Superuser` `Run the Development Serve`:
   Set up the database by applying migrations:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

   - social should now be running locally at http://127.0.0.1:8000/


5. Access the Admin Interface:
   Access the Django admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and log in with the superuser credentials you
   created earlier. Here, you can manage social data and configurations.

- This "Getting Started with social Django Development" section provides developers with the steps and requirements to begin developing social with Django. You can customize it further based on your specific development workflow and project requirements.
